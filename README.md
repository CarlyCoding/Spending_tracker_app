This spending tracker was a solo project where the brief was to deliver an app that allowed the user to manage their spending. This app allowes the user to:

  - Create new merchants, to log their spending against.

  - Create new spending tags, to categorise their spending (eg. "Travel expenses")

  - Create new transactions, with the user being able to assign a merchant and spending tag against this as well as monetary value.

  - View all transactions in list, with new transactions being added to this list after logging.


This app was written in Python, with PostgreSQL for the database. Flask was used as the web server, and the app was styled with HMTL and CSS. 

Note: The brief stated that using JavaScript was not permitted, along with Material UI which is why HMTL and CSS were soley used.
